# Bootstrap-Portfolio-Andrea-Melisa
My portfolio application made using bootstrap.

## Description

This project is the third challenge from the bootcamp. In this case I needed  rebuild my portfolio application from last challenge but using bootstrap:

The site should have the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar at the top.
      - Include links that are applicable to my portfolio.
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section
        - A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and any other information i'd like to include.

    - A work section
      - A section displaying the work in grid. 
      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.
        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.
      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section
      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.
      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.
      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

The Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
